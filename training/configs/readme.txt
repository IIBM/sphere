Readme:
When you press "save" on the main program, configuration files will be generated in this folder ( training/configs/ ).

These files contain variables specific to each training type, which are:
- Pavlov mode: config_Pavlov.py
- Skinner mode: config_Skinner.py
- Operant Conditioning mode: config_Ocond.py
- Discrimination mode: config_Discr.py



If you generate these config files, they will have priority over default configurations (which are set in training/config_training.py)
